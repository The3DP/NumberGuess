In case you wanted to know, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE to cheat since the code is told to generate random.

No AI bots or extensions were used in this code.

Like I said before, the code (in Python) is told to generate a random word.
this is without the use of any AI word generators or anything related whatsoever.
---------------------------------
Code example: import random
---------------------------------




import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
random_integer = random.randint(1, 100)
print(f"Random Integer: {random_integer}")

# Generate a random floating-point number between 0 and 1
random_float = random.random()
print(f"Random Float: {random_float}")

# Now you should choose a random element from a list
choices = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
random_choice = random.choice(choices)
print(f"Random Choice: {random_choice}")
